Hello, guys!

I am electronic music lover from Lithuania, keen on photography and travel. Currently I learn to code for about a year or so and I am willing to re-qualify from business management into IT sector. What I already learned is HTML5, CSS & SQL. Most of the time JavaScript, PHP seems challenging to me. So my main goal is to learn those languages better.

Regards,
